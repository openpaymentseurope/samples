# Description 
C# .NET Core example implementation of creation, authorization and use of an AIS consent for Open Payments Europe AB:s NextGen PSD2 REST API:s. 

This example demonstrates how to implement a full flow of creating and authorising a Consent that can then be used to access bank account information, supporting OAuthRedirect, Redirect and Decoupled SCA approaches with the end user.

Please note that this is a simplified implementation with a pedagogic purpose of explaining the flow. A production implementation obviously needs more attention to error handling, dealing with asynchronicity and concurrency of multiple consent processing requests.

# Prerequisites

## API client credentials
Sign-up with Open Payments Europe's Developer Portal and register an application to acquire your API client credentials (Note that you must register your application to be using the Account Information (AIS) API to use it with this demo).
https://developer.openpayments.io/

## Download and install Microsoft .Net Core 
https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download

## macOS specific
If you are running this demo on macOS, you need to install the graphics library `mono-libgdiplus` for the QR-code generation. Please proceed with the following steps.

### Install Homebrew for macOS
https://brew.sh

### Install mono-libgdiplus for QR code image generation
In Terminal:
```
brew install mono-libgdiplus
```

# Building
```
dotnet build
```

# Configuration
appsettings.json
```json5
{
  "ClientId": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx", // An API client id created in our Developer Portal
  "ClientSecret": "yoursupersecretpassword",          // Your client secret also from Developer Portal
  "RedirectURI": "https://acme.com/",                 // A redirect URI registered with the client in Developer Portal
  "PSUContextScope": "private",                       // Which context to use, "private" or "corporate" accounts
  "PSUId": "199311219639",                            // SSN of person with access to the account information
  "PSUCorporateId": "",                               // If corporate context, your corporate id with the bank is given here
  "UseProductionEnvironment": false,                  // If true, production environment is used, otherwise sandbox
  "ProductionClientCertificateFile": "acme.com.pfx",  // If production environment, your client certificate filename
  "PSUIPAddress": "192.168.0.1",                      // The PSU IP address to present to the bank
  "PSUUserAgent": "mozilla/5.0"                       // The PSU user agent to present to the bank
}
```
* Edit the `appsettings.json` file and set your specific `ClientId`, `ClientSecret` and `RedirectURI` obtained from Open Payments Developer Portal.
* If you are creating consent for corporate account, you also need to set `PSUCorporateId` to be used for the specific bank (this is for most Swedish banks the company organisation number). 
* If you are using the production environment, `UseProductionEnvironment` must be set to `true` and `ProductionClientCertificateFile` must be the filename of your production client certificate (obtained when you onboarded your company to our production environment in Developer Portal) and the certificate file must be in the project directory of this application.

# Running
```
dotnet run <BicFi> [<AffiliatedASPSPId>]
```
Where `BicFi` is the identifier of any of the available banks in the chosen environment (e.g. ESSESESS, HANDSESS, NDESESS, SWEDSESS etc.).
`AffiliatedASPSPId` is an additional optional identifier to point out which "bank office" to address (currently only used by SWEDSESS Sparbanker) and can be obtained from our ASPSP Information API using the `Get ASPSP Details` endpoint.
